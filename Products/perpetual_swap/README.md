# Overview 

A perpetual swap is a future or option without an expiration date 

In futures and swaps, the expiration date is the key mechanism that makes the derivative and the underlying asset eventually converge, so removing this mechanism requires having another one with same function. 

In Perpetual Swaps it is the funding rate mechanism: the idea is ones on the favorable side of the trade pay the ones on the unfavorable side of the trade 

So for example is the P.S. spot price is > underlying spot price then long traders pay short traders a fee, and of course if P.S. spot price < underlying spot price it is vice versa. 

This mechanism generates a force which makes P.S. price track the underlying price.
